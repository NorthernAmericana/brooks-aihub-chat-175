## What this repo is

Brooks AI HUB - A Mobile AI Chat and Marketplace for apps and games and media.

## Editions & Repositories

Brooks AI HUB is **one product** available through **two separate repositories**:

- **[Mobile Edition](https://github.com/NorthernAmericana/brooks-aihub-chat-175)** (this repo): The primary App Router-based web and mobile application. These docs primarily describe the Mobile edition.
  
- **[Console Edition](https://github.com/NorthernAmericana/brooks-ai-hub-console175)**: Optimized for Raspberry Pi and handheld kiosk deployments, featuring a fullscreen launcher interface and cloud sync capabilities for physical installations and embedded devices.

Both editions share the same Brooks AI HUB vision and are part of the same product ecosystem.
