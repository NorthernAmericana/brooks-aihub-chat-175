# Brooks AI HUB vision

## What Brooks AI HUB is

Brooks AI HUB is the trust-first “Control Center OS” for Northern Americana Tech: a PWA-first hub that acts as a launcher + marketplace + data center for NAT apps, ATOs, games, and media.

It’s not “just a chat app.” It’s a home base where users:

- sign in once,
- manage access/subscriptions,
- interact with ATOs (agentic tools/characters),
- browse games/media,
- and keep their memories, receipts, saves, and history centralized.

## Core product decision

✅ **HUB stays a PWA (and can become a TWA wrapper on Android)**

- Brooks AI HUB remains the PWA “Console OS.”
- It can be packaged as a TWA for Android convenience/distribution.
- But it’s designed to work everywhere (mobile + desktop) without becoming trapped in one store ecosystem.

✅ **NAT apps “graduate” when they’re ready**

- Apps/ATOs can start as “tiles” inside the HUB (web/PWA experiences), then later “graduate” to:
  - Google Play Android apps
  - Steam / itch.io releases
  - standalone web apps
- …while the HUB stays the account + memory + entitlement center.

## How games + media fit in (the ecosystem rule)

Brooks AI HUB is the launcher + library, not necessarily the final platform for everything.

**Mobile inside HUB:**

- light/limited versions (demos, “Founder Access” builds, teasers, episodic content)
- lore, trailers, OST playlists, devlogs
- cloud-backed profile + save hooks when possible

**Full releases outside HUB:**

- Steam / itch.io for PC games
- Google Play for full Android builds
- external links are normal — the HUB is the “front door”

Think: HUB = library card + dashboard, not “one app to host every runtime forever.”

## Founders Access subscription (the business spine)

Founders Access is the membership layer that unlocks:

- premium HUB themes + features
- early builds / demo episodes of games
- special ATO routes (more capable modes)
- media drops (soundtracks, devlogs, “Signals” feed)
- future perks: discounts, cosmetics, “Founder-only events,” etc.

This is the “sustaining engine” while NAT grows.

## ATOs + Apps: how they’re organized

Brooks AI HUB uses slash-style routes for clarity and vibe:

Examples:

- `/brooksbears` — companion / mascot experience
- `/myflowerai` — tracking + journaling + insights (harm-reduction boundaries)
- `/mycarmindato` — travel/driver/trucker/delivery modes + local guide loop
- `/namc` — Northern Americana Media Collection (curated media, Signals feed)

**Rule:** each ATO/app is isolated enough to be its own product later, but the HUB is where:

- accounts live
- entitlements are checked
- receipts/memories can be exported/controlled
- cross-product continuity is maintained

## Data philosophy (why the HUB exists)

The HUB is a data center with user trust at the core:

- clear memory controls
- export/delete controls
- “receipts-first” logging (sessions, turns, artifacts)
- strict separation between ATOs unless user allows sharing

The HUB is the user’s control panel.
That’s the brand promise.

## Cross-platform linking rules (clean + consistent)

When a user is on:

- **mobile** → link to Google Play / web demos / lightweight experiences
- **desktop** → link to Steam / itch.io / full media pages

The HUB should make this feel intentional:

- “Play Demo” vs “Get Full Game”
- “Open in Steam” (desktop)
- “Install on Android” (mobile)

## Roadmap snapshot (simple)

**Phase 0 — HUB as real “Console OS”**

- stable auth + navigation + tiles
- receipts/memory model working
- core ATO routes live as MVP tiles

**Phase 1 — Founders Access spine**

- subscription gating
- library pages + entitlements
- premium unlocks

**Phase 2 — Graduation pipeline**

- define “what earns graduation”
- turn top ATOs into standalone Android apps
- ship at least one game/media drop with clear “demo vs full” pathway

**Phase 3 — Ecosystem maturity**

- consistent UX across ATOs
- exportable memories / user data tools
- curated marketplace vibe (NAT-only initially, expand later if desired)

## One-sentence mantra

Brooks AI HUB is the PWA “Control Center OS” where users manage identity, access, memories, and launch NAT worlds — while big releases can live on the best platform for their format.
