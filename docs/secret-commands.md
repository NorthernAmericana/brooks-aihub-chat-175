# Secret Commands

Secret commands are hidden, discoverable features in Brooks AI HUB that provide fun, interactive experiences beyond the standard chat interface. These commands are intentionally not explicitly documented in the main UI, making them special "easter eggs" for users to discover and share.

## What are Secret Commands?

Secret commands are special message patterns that trigger unique behaviors or tools when typed into the chat. They're designed to:

- **Be discoverable**: Users can find them through exploration, hints, or sharing with others
- **Be fun**: They provide unique, engaging experiences beyond typical chat interactions
- **Be non-intrusive**: They don't interfere with normal chat usage
- **Be memorable**: They use intuitive patterns that are easy to remember once discovered

## How Secret Commands Work

Secret commands follow a specific pattern:
```
/NAMC/ [trigger phrase]
```

The `/NAMC/` prefix indicates a special command related to Northern Americana Media Catalog (NAMC) content and experiences.

## Current Secret Commands

### Movie Player
**Trigger**: `/NAMC/ let me watch a movie`

Opens a fullscreen video player that plays the "Fresh Milk" short film. The player includes a close button (X) to return to the chat interface.

## Adding New Secret Commands

To add a new secret command:

1. Define the trigger pattern in the message processing logic
2. Create the associated component or functionality
3. Add the command to this documentation
4. Test the command thoroughly to ensure it doesn't interfere with normal chat

## Design Philosophy

Secret commands should:
- Feel like discovering a hidden gem
- Be simple and intuitive once discovered
- Enhance the user experience without cluttering the interface
- Relate to NAMC content or the Brooks AI HUB ecosystem
