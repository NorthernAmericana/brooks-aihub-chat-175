# What is Brooks AI HUB?

## 1) One-sentence product definition

Brooks AI HUB is a trust-first PWA control-center that connects official NAT ATO apps through route-based navigation while keeping chat, memory, and account controls in one place.

## 2) Who it is for

- **Founders** who want paid access to premium routes and early experiences in the current hub.
- **Creators** who want a central place to access NAT app experiences and media-related surfaces.
- **Drivers** who want MyCarMindATO travel/exploration and driver-focused tools.
- **Media fans** who want NAMC library, reader, and lore-oriented experiences.

## 3) What is live now vs in-progress vs future

### Live now

- Hub pages are live for **Store** (`/store`) and **Pricing** (`/pricing`).
- Official app routes are present for:
  - **MyFlowerAI** (`/MyFlowerAI`)
  - **BrooksBears** (`/BrooksBears` and `/BrooksBears/BenjaminBear`)
  - **MyCarMindATO** (`/MyCarMindATO` and `/mycarmind`)
  - **NAMC** (`/NAMC`)
- Additional app-detail/store routes are present, including `/myflowerai-app`, `/brooksbears-app`, `/mycarmindato-app`, and `/namc-app`.
- Memory and settings surfaces are present at `/memories` and `/settings`.

### In progress

- The docs describe active work around the trust model: receipts/transparency, memory control boundaries, and cross-device continuity.
- The repo includes ongoing product expansion areas (for example NAMC library/reader/lore surfaces and MyCarMindATO exploration features) that are already scaffolded across app routes and docs.

### Future

- Directionally, Brooks AI HUB is positioned to keep growing as a central NAT control center for official apps, media access, and trust controls.
- Future expansion is framed in repo docs as phased evolution (for example stronger export/delete flows, broader ecosystem surfaces, and platform graduation), not as date-based promises.

## 4) How NAT, NAMC, and Brooks AI HUB relate

Northern Americana Tech (NAT) is the umbrella company; Brooks AI HUB is the product hub app; NAMC is NAT’s media collection surface inside that ecosystem.

- **NAT**: parent company/umbrella.
- **NAMC**: Northern Americana Media Collection, the media arm and catalog experience.
- **Brooks AI HUB**: the control-center app that hosts official ATO app routes (including NAMC access) plus shared account, memory, and trust controls.

## 5) Why users should pay now (current founder value, not future promises)

Current paid value is based on what the pricing and entitlement copy already states in-repo:

- Paid access is available now from `/pricing`.
- Current paid copy emphasizes:
  - premium/paid-only ATO routes,
  - higher monthly quotas for unofficial ATO creation and uploads,
  - and priority access framing for NAMC/experimental experiences.
- Founders perks are already represented in the live pricing UI via the in-app perks list.
