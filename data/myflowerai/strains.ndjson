More couch-locking.","vs_london_pound_cake":"Comparable potency and sedative effects. Some users report Southern Pound Cake rivaling London Pound Cake batches. Southern Pound Cake has more vanilla/cake notes vs London's more berry-forward profile.","vs_kush_mints":"Maintains Kush Mints' powerful relaxation while adding Wedding Cake's sweeter vanilla flavor profile and more pronounced mood elevation.","vs_la_kush_cake":"Same genetics (Wedding Cake \u00d7 Kush Mints) but Southern Pound Cake is Trulieve's specific pheno #7. LA Kush Cake may vary by producer.","vs_sanctuary_wedding_mints":"Very similar genetics (Wedding Cake \u00d7 Kush Mints #11 vs pheno #7). Sanctuary's version priced similarly ($30-40/eighth) but different phenotype selection."},"flavor_profile_detail":"Opens with sweet vanilla cake layered with gassy richness. The 'minty, cakey dough' scent fills the room and transfers well to taste. Inhale brings sweet vanilla frosting and baked goods with subtle floral notes (linalool). Exhale reveals light peppery earth (caryophyllene), cool mint (limonene), and doughy cake batter. The flavor coats your mouth and lingers pleasantly. Smooth, rich smoke. Overall a pronounced terpene profile that exceeds expectations for a budget-tier strain.","consumer_feedback_summary":{"quality":"Bag appeal is average - machine-trimmed with variable bud sizes (small to medium, some 'popcorn' nugs). However, buds are still frosty with abundant trichomes and great cure (not overly dry, slightly sticky). Quality satisfactory for price point.","aroma_flavor":"Consistently praised. 'Minty, cakey dough' aroma that 'transfers to taste very well.' Users surprised a value-tier strain has such pronounced terpene profile. 'Pretty awesome' flavor with sweet cake and vanilla balanced by gassy, minty backend.","effects_potency":"Where it truly excels. 'Gets me very medicated' at $20-25/eighth. Heavy-hitting and relaxing. 'Couldn't believe I didn't have to reach for something stronger.' Compared favorably to more expensive strains. 'Very stoney,' 'heavy indica leaning,' potent sedative buzz that outperforms some higher-priced indicas.","value":"Exceptional. 'Getting top-shelf effects for bottom-shelf cost.' 'For $20 it's a great ass deal.' Has 'sleeper hit' status - not flashy but delivers where it counts. 'One of the best budget indica flowers in Florida market.' Minor downsides: inconsistent bud size, slightly less flavorful than ultra-premium boutique batches, but critiques are mild given price.","overall_sentiment":"Highly recommended by Florida patients. Strong reputation for value. 'Punches above its weight.' Perfect for evening relief. Go-to for medical users seeking pain, stress, and sleep support at affordable price. Be prepared for potent, couch-locking experience and have snacks ready."},"pricing_detail":{"regular_price_usd":35.0,"common_sale_price_usd":25.0,"promotional_low_price_usd":20.0,"price_per_gram_regular":10.0,"price_per_gram_sale":7.14,"price_per_gram_promo":5.71,"pricing_notes":"Trulieve frequently runs promotions. Patients commonly purchase at $25/eighth during sales. Occasional special deals bring it to $20/eighth (e.g., $40 quarter-ounce deals). At $20-25, it's one of the best bang-for-buck indica flowers in Florida."}},"freshness_guidance":{"best_storage":"Store in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. Ideal temperature is 60-70\u00b0F (15-21\u00b0C) with 59-63% relative humidity. Due to its rich terpene content, proper storage is essential to maintain the dessert-like aroma and flavor.","typical_shelf_life_days":180,"notes":"Flower quality begins to degrade after opening. Terpenes are volatile and evaporate over time, especially the delicate dessert notes. Use within 3-6 months of purchase for optimal experience. The high resin content helps preserve potency but proper humidity control is crucial.","do_not_store_in_public":["opened_date","remaining_g","purchase_date","purchase_location","user_stash_amount"]},"packaging":{"container_type_suggestions":["Glass jar with airtight seal","CVault container","Mason jar with humidity pack"],"humidipack_recommended":true}}
