# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support security fixes for the latest released version on the default branch and
current production deployments. If you are running an older fork or a pinned
revision, please upgrade to the most recent commit on `main` before reporting a
security issue.

| Version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| `main` (latest) | ✅ |
| Older releases | ❌ |

## Disclosure Expectations

We appreciate responsible disclosure and ask that you:

- Avoid publicly disclosing or exploiting vulnerabilities.
- Share enough detail to reproduce the issue (steps, payloads, logs, screenshots).
- Allow us reasonable time to investigate and remediate before any public report.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately by emailing **security@brooksaihub.app**.
Include a clear subject line such as "Security vulnerability report" and provide
reproduction steps, impact assessment, and any supporting materials.

If email is not possible, open a **private GitHub Security Advisory** in this
repository so the report remains confidential.
