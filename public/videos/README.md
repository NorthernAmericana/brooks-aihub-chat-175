## fresh-milk.mp4

This file should contain the "Fresh Milk" short film that plays when users discover the secret movie command.

**To add the video:**
1. Place the `fresh-milk.mp4` file in this directory
2. Ensure the file is in MP4 format with H.264 video codec for broad browser compatibility
3. Recommended: Keep file size reasonable for web streaming (under 50MB if possible)

**Current status:** Placeholder - actual video needs to be added

The video is referenced in the application at: `/videos/fresh-milk.mp4`
