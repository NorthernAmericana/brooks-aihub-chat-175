## Overview

_My Daughter, Death_ is an atmospheric exploration game set in the frozen pocket-reality of New Bethlehem. Players navigate as Cutz, the hardened bounty hunter, protecting the Death child figure while uncovering the cosmic mysteries of this strange world.

The game features cutting-edge NPCAI technology, creating up to 60 non-player characters with deep, LLM-driven personalities that respond dynamically to player choices and actions.

## NPCAI System — Revolutionary Character Technology

### What is NPCAI?

NPCAI (Non-Player Character Artificial Intelligence) represents a breakthrough in video game character interaction. Instead of scripted dialogue trees, each NPC is powered by a large language model (LLM) that generates responses based on:

- **Personality Profile:** Unique traits, motivations, fears, and desires
- **Memory System:** NPCs remember past interactions with the player
- **Story Context:** NPCs understand their role in the larger narrative
- **Emotional State:** Dynamic mood changes based on events and player actions
- **Relationship Dynamics:** NPCs form opinions about the player over time

### NPCAI Character Count

- **Up to 60 NPCAI Characters:** Each with distinct personalities
- **Main Cast:** 10-15 deeply developed characters central to the story
- **Supporting Characters:** 20-30 characters with medium-depth interactions
- **Background Characters:** 15-25 characters for atmospheric depth
- **Dynamic Encounters:** Not all NPCs appear in every playthrough

### How NPCAI Enhances Gameplay

1. **Natural Conversations:** Speak freely; NPCs understand context and intent
2. **Emergent Storytelling:** Unique narrative moments based on your interactions
3. **Relationship Building:** Meaningful connections that affect story outcomes
4. **Replayability:** Different conversations and outcomes each playthrough
5. **Authentic World:** New Bethlehem feels alive with believable characters

### NPCAI Technical Details

- **Deep Personality Models:** Each character has extensive background lore
- **Contextual Awareness:** NPCs know about recent events in the game world
