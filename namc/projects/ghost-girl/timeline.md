# Ghost Girl — Timeline Beats

Scaffolding only; spoiler-safe until confirmed. For canonical details, see [`namc/lore/ghost-girl.lore.md`](../../lore/ghost-girl.lore.md).

## Timeline (Scaffolding, Non-Canon Until Confirmed)
- **Act I / Opening:** Ethan arrives at college; Gretchen appears to him; he believes she has returned.
- **Act II / Complication:** Raven grows close to Ethan; the triangle intensifies as Ethan’s perception frays.
- **Act III / Fallout:** Ethan’s instability peaks; choices between memory and reality culminate.
