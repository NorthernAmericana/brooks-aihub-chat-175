# Ghost Girl — Canon Lore Dictionary

## Logline
A first-year college student believes his childhood friend has returned as an adult, pulling him into a tender, unstable triangle where memory and reality keep slipping out of sync.

## Metadata
- **Status:** Coming soon
- **Release date:** TBA
- **Format:** Short film

## Overview (Spoiler-Safe)
**Ghost Girl** is an upcoming short film set during the first year of college. It follows **Ethan White**, a 19-year-old who begins seeing a blonde girl in a white dress—an adult version of **Gretchen Ross**, his childhood friend and first love who died when they were kids. Ethan becomes convinced Gretchen has somehow returned, but the story keeps a tense ambiguity: what he’s seeing feels emotionally real while reality stays unstable.

Ethan’s present-day connection is **Raven Ross** (Gretchen’s cousin), also 19, who becomes his love interest and emotional anchor—grounded, human, and unable to see what Ethan sees. This creates an indie psychological love triangle driven by grief, longing, and unreliable perception: Ethan is pulled between the comfort of the “ghost girl” presence and the living relationship forming with Raven. The tone is intimate and eerie rather than supernatural-action—more “memory as a haunting” than jump-scares—where the central question is whether Ethan is being visited, hallucinating, or self-medicating his way into a story he needs to believe.
