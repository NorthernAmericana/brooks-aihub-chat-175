## Logline (Spoiler-Free)
A grieving first-year college student believes his childhood friend has returned as they were, pulling him into a tender, volatile triangle that tests memory, reality, and love.

## Spoiler-Safe Synopsis
Ethan White, new to college and still tender from loss, begins encountering Gretchen Ross—his childhood friend who died years ago—appearing to him as if she never left. As Ethan clings to her presence, he grows close to Gretchen’s cousin, Raven Ross, who cannot see Gretchen and becomes his grounded counterweight. Their bond forms a psychological love triangle that tracks Ethan’s increasingly unstable perception, where grief and longing blur the border between comfort and harm.

## Spoilers (Reveal-Allowed)
> [SPOILERS_ALLOWED]

- **Reveal:** Ethan’s visions of Gretchen are tied to psychosis and drug use; he is using substances to see her again.

## Character Dossiers

### Ethan White
- **Role:** Protagonist; first-year college student
- **Core Drive:** Grief, attachment, and the need to keep Gretchen close
- **Current State:** Experiencing psychosis; increasingly destabilized
- **Spoiler-Safe Note:** His perceptions are unreliable, and his yearning shapes the story’s emotional gravity.

### Gretchen Ross
- **Role:** Deceased childhood friend; central apparition/vision
- **Presence:** Appears to Ethan as the same age he is now
- **Function:** Embodies memory, longing, and the “ghost” that Ethan cannot release

### Raven Ross
- **Role:** Gretchen’s cousin; love interest; reality tether
- **Trait:** Cannot see Gretchen
- **Function:** Grounds Ethan in the present and challenges his retreat into the past

## Relationship Map (Text-Based)
- **Ethan ↔ Gretchen:** Attachment and grief; Ethan believes “she’s back,” deepening his dependence
- **Ethan ↔ Raven:** Romantic tension; reality vs. escapism conflict
- **Raven ↔ Gretchen:** Family bond and absence; memory contrasts with Ethan’s hallucination

## Timeline Scaffolding (Non-Canon Until Confirmed)
- **Act I / Opening:** Ethan arrives at college; Gretchen appears; Ethan believes she has returned.
- **Act II / Complication:** Raven enters and grows close to Ethan; the triangle intensifies as Ethan’s perception frays.
- **Act III / Fallout:** Ethan’s instability peaks; choices between memory and reality culminate.

## Themes & Motifs
- Grief and denial
- Memory vs. reality
- Addiction / drug-enabled escapism
- Unreliable perception
- Love triangle as psychological conflict
- Identity fracture
- “Ghost” as a coping mechanism
