# My Daughter, Death — Canon Lore Dictionary

## Logline
A hardened bounty hunter protects a child-linked embodiment of Death in the frozen pocket-reality of New Bethlehem, where love and cosmic rules collide.

## Metadata
- **Status:** Coming soon
- **Release date:** TBA
- **Formats:** Novel (_My Daughter, Death: Frostbitten_) + Video game (_My Daughter, Death_)

## Overview (Spoiler-Safe)
**My Daughter, Death** is a cross-media story told as both a novel and a video game. The novel is titled **_My Daughter, Death: Frostbitten_**, and the game is titled **_My Daughter, Death_**. Both share a canon spine: a grief-soaked, myth-tech collision where human love and cosmic forces overlap.

At the center is **Cutz**, a hardened bounty hunter in a frozen pocket-reality called **New Bethlehem**, a place with an unnatural relationship to death and permanence. Cutz becomes the protector of a strange child figure associated with “Death”—a presence that’s both intimate (a child you can hold and fear for) and metaphysical (an idea that stains the world). Looming over the story is **The Watcher**, a cosmic hunter archetype tied to the universe’s rules and their violation. The narrative carries a surreal, philosophical energy: reality feels fragile, like it’s been torn and patched; love becomes both salvation and obsession; and “creation” becomes a dangerous attempt to outrun loss.

The tone is bleak but not hopeless—woodsy-cosmic, uncanny, and tender in flashes. In the game adaptation, lore is expressed through exploration, atmosphere, and abrupt cutaway moments (including an intentionally “weird FMV” vibe), while the novel offers deeper internal logic and mythic framing. **Frostbitten** functions as the novel arc label: cold permanence, repeating cycles, and the feeling that the world has been sealed into a winter it can’t escape.
